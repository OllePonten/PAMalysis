# One tailed Z'-factor
# http://www.cellprofiler.org/CPmanual/CalculateStatistics.html
# OneTailedZfactor: This measure is an attempt to overcome a limitation of the 
# original Z'-factor formulation (it assumes a Gaussian distribution) and is 
# informative for populations with moderate or high amounts of skewness. In 
# these cases, long tails opposite to the mid-range point lead to a high 
# standard deviation for either population, which results in a low Z' factor #
# even though the population means and samples between the means may be 
# well-separated. 
# Therefore, the one-tailed Z' factor is calculated with the same formula but 
# using only those samples that lie between the positive/negative population 
# means.
